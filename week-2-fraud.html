# Corporate Governance

What is Corporate Governance&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;?

&gt; "The shareholders' role in governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place. The responsibilities of the board include setting the company’s strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the management of the business and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship. The board’s actions are subject to laws, regulations and the shareholders in general meeting."

# The early history

A short history of The Cadbury Report (1992); The Greenbury Report (1995); The Hampel
Report (1998):

* Sudden financial collapses of two companies, the Wallpaper Group's Coloroll and Asil Nadir’s Polly Peck consortium (despite healthy published accounts);

* Increasing lack of investor confidence in the honesty and accountability of listed companies;

* 1991, the Financial Reporting Council, the London Stock Exchange, and the accountancy profession established the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance (known as the Cadbury Committee after Adrian Cadbury, the Chairman)

* . . .

---

# The early history

A short history of The Cadbury Report (1992); The Greenbury Report (1995); The Hampel
Report (1998):

* The Cadbury Committee recommended a “Code of Best Practice” to achieve high standards of corporate behaviour.

* The Cadbury Report (1992) was followed by the Greenbury Report (1995) which focused on best practice with regards to directors’ remuneration.

* The Greenbury Report was published by a committee (chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury) established by the United Kingdom Confederation of Business and Industry on corporate governance.

* The Hampel Report (final report) . . .

---

# The early history

A short history of The Cadbury Report (1992); The Greenbury Report (1995); The Hampel
Report (1998):

* The Committee on Corporate Governance (the Hampel Committee chaired by Sir Ronnie Hampel) was established in November 1995 to review the Cadbury Committee’s recommendations on corporate governance.

* The Hampel Report (final report) in 1998 drew together the codes of practice established by the earlier Cadbury and Greenbury Reports and led to the creation of a new “Combined Code” of corporate governance.

---

# The Cadbury Code 1992

The Cadbury Code:

* a clear division of responsibilities at the top: the position of Chairman of the Board should be separated from that of Chief Executive, or there be a strong independent element on the board;

*  the majority of the Board be comprised of outside directors;

*  remuneration committees for Board members be made up in the majority of non-executive directors; and

*  the Board should appoint an Audit Committee including at least three non-executive directors.

---

# The Turnbull Guidance 1999

The Turnbull Guidance:

* In 1999, the London Stock Exchange set up a working party chaired by Nigel Turnbull, then Finance Director of Rank Group plc, to address issues in the Combined Code (What is this Combined Code?).

* In September 1999, the Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code was published (the Turnbull Guidance).

     + integrated risk management into internal control assessment and     reporting

     + stressed the responsibility of the board for risk management,     internal control assessment and reporting

     + extended the review and reporting obligation to cover, not just     internal financial control, but all areas of control     (operational, financial and compliance)

---

# The Turnbull Guidance 1999

The four stage framework:

* Stage 1. Identify and assess risks by looking at aspects such as completeness of risks assessed, the impact and probability of a risk materialising together with time frames;

*   Stage 2. Design appropriate controls over the risks. Controls should be embedded in systems, should include both preventative and detective measures and be cost-effective and proportionate;

*   Stage 3. Test that the controls are working. Here the aim is to be able to state positively that the controls are operating in practice in accordance with their design; and

*   Stage 4. Conclude on the effectiveness of the internal control system. This should be carried out annually by the board, as stipulated in the framework.

---

# The new Combined Code 2003

The Turnbull Guidance was replaced:

* Corporate failures in 2001 in the US revealed some loopholes in corporate governance. The UK responded by the creation of the Higgs Committee (in relation to role and effectiveness of non-executive directors) and the Smith Committee (in relation to audit committee in a company) in 2002.

* Both reports of Higgs and Smith recommended a revision of the Combined Code.

* In 2003, the new Combined Code was published.

---

# The new Combined Code 2003

The Turnbull Guidance was replaced:

* In 2004, the Financial Reporting Council established the Turnbull Review Group

*  On 13 October 2005, Financial Reporting Council published Internal Control Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code

*  In September 2014, the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Report was published. This guidance replaced Internal Control Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.

# Walker Review

Walker Review Terms of Reference:

&gt; “To examine corporate governance in the UK banking industry and make recommendations, including in the following areas: the effectiveness of risk management at board level, including the incentives in remuneration policy to manage risk effectively; the balance of skills, experience and independence required on the boards of UK banking institutions; the effectiveness of board practices and the performance of audit, risk, remuneration and nomination committees; the role of institutional shareholders in engaging effectively with companies and monitoring of boards; . . . ”

# Modern internal controls frameworks

Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Framework 2013) COSO Cube:

*  Supermarket cashier (one level of the organisation)

     + What is the job?

     + what is the process, workflow required?

*  Is it efficient and accurate (one of the objectives)

*  Risk assessment (one of the components of control)

     + What are events that affect the achievement of objectives?

     + What are the possibility of the events occurring?

     + What is the tolerance of the risk?

     + How to ensure the tolerance level is not breached?

# Corporate Governance

COSO Internal Control process:

* What is the ‘thing’ which we want to control?

  + Answer: risk to an objective.

*  What is the objective?

  + Answer: Something we wish to achieve in the company (department, section).

*  What risks may exist to achieve the objective?

  + Answer: . . . (what if there is no risk?)

*  What control we can put in to control the risks?

  + Answer: . . .

*  . . .

---

# Risk Assessment

A dynamic and iterative process for identifying and assessing risks:

*  Risks can be classified by 4 areas:

     + Strategic – including Political risk, talent and succession     planning risk, and risk from dependencies on other organizations

     + Financial – including risk of audit findings and other things     that would undermine reporting integrity

     + Compliance – including Fraud and non-compliance with fair     employment practices

     + Operational – including the risk that Programs fail to meet     their objectives, natural disasters, and lack of technology     availability

# Investigation model II

Another Model of Investigation: A fraud investigation must be
approached as a management exercise: carried out the plan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

*  What do you want to achieve?

*  What resources do you need?

*  How are you going to get the data (evidence)?

*  Are you going to make sure you can use the data (evidence)?

]

---

# Investigation model II

What do I want to achieve `\(=\)` setting the priorities&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

*  The objective of a fraud investigation is to obtain information, AND to do something with the information, e.g.

     + punish the perpetrators of the fraud

     + get an injunction to prevent further damage

     + get an injunction to freeze proceeds of fraud

     + recovery of asset

*  Priorities closely related to “resources”.

---

# Investigation model II

What resources you need to achieve the objectives&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;?

*  Team leader;

*  Team structure; and

*  Information technology.

]

---

# Investigation model II

What resources you need to achieve the objectives? Pyramid structure&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

*  one team leader at the top making decisions;

*  a small number of analysts (legal or financial) analysing data; and

*  a large number of investigators gathering data.

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Leigh Warnick, [The Investigation of Fraud.](https://bit.ly/2QFip7x): Proceedings of Complex Commercial Fraud Conference held 20-23 August 1991.

---

# Investigation model II

Inverted pyramid structure&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

*  one team leader at the top making decisions (assisted by an administrator);

*  four analysts (three legal and one financial);

*  three investigators; and

*  one clerical assistant.

---

# Investigation model II

Operation of the inverted pyramid structure&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

&gt; “Then the team leader can brief the lawyers on the priorities of the investigation; the lawyers translate the overall priorities into an action plan for the part of the investigation delegated to them, and each lawyer works with an investigator to gather the evidence he needs. Then the lawyers analyse the evidence collected and report to the team leader. The financial analyst provides expert advice on financial matters when and where needed.”

# A case of bank response

---

# A bank

Suspicious customer funds:

*  A bank suspected that funds received into a customer’s account by transfer from overseas were proceeds of crime or a money laundering operation, e.g. stolen from a third party.

*  Can the bank refused to accept the transfer, i.e. send the sum back to the sender?

*  Can the bank inform the customer of its suspicions and ask him to provide evidence of its legitimacy?

*  . . .

---

# A bank

Suspicious customer funds:

*  If the bank accepted the transfer (without asking the customer), did the bank commit a money laundering offence?

*  If the bank accepted the transfer (without asking the customer) and the customer attempted to withdraw the sum, should the bank refuse?

*  If the bank refused the customer to withdraw the sum (without asking the customer), what could the customer do (assuming in fact, the customer obtained the sum lawfully from a third party)?

*  If the bank accepted the transfer and allowed the customer to withdraw the sum, what could the third party do (assuming in fact, some one stole the sum from a third party and transferred the sum to the customer)?

---

# Legal context

*  Common law duty of a bank

*  Constructive trusteeship

*  Criminal Justice Act 1988 (repealed)

*  Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

---

# Common law duty of a bank

Subject to CJA and PCA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:


*  a bank is entitled to treat the customer’s mandate at its face value save in extreme cases

*  the bank is not obliged to question any transaction which is in accordance with the mandate, unless

     + (e.g. an account with two signatories) a reasonable banker would     have grounds for believing that the authorised signatories are     misusing their authority for the purpose of defrauding their     principal

*  . . .

# Common law duty of a bank

Subject to CJA and PCA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

*  if a bank does not have reasonable grounds for believing that there is fraud it must pay;

*  mere suspicion or unease do not constitute reasonable grounds

*  a bank is not required to act as an amateur detective.

# Liability as a constructive trustee

Two situations where liability as a constructive trustee arises:

* A bank is deemed to hold a sum of money (“as a constructive trustee” for)
(on behalf of) a true owner of the sum, if the bank&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

     + knows the sum that it holds does not belong its customer; or

     + is put on notice that the sum may not belong to its customer.

# Criminal Justice Act 1988

*  It is a criminal offence for a bank to act on a customer’s instructions where it knew or suspected that the relevant assets were the proceeds of criminal conduct (Section 93A(1) of the CJA 1988)

*  It is a defence to a bank where it notified the police and received their consent to proceed or it notified them as soon as reasonably possible after the event on its own initiative (Section 93A(4) of the CJA 1988).

---

# Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

*  It is an offence to enter into or become involved in an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person (Section 328(1) of the PCA 2002)

*  It is offence to notify a person that a money laundering investigation is taking place (Section 333 of the PCA 2002).

*  If a person makes an authorised disclosure an officer (section 338 of the PCA 2002), he is treated as having the appropriate consent to do a prohibited act (means the three types of money laundering), if within a certain period he does not receive a notice that the consent is refused (section 335 of the PCA 2002).

*Tayeb v HSBC and another*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

&gt; “The events in Tayeb occurred in 2000 (So Criminal Justice Act 1988 applied). The claimant was an overseas customer . . .  who had no permanent address in the United Kingdom. On selling a database of Libyan internet domain names to an overseas buyer, it was agreed that the consideration would be paid from an account held by the buyer at Barclays Bank in London to his personal bank account held with an HSBC branch in Derby. . . . ” (brackets added)
